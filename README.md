Some general things for now:

Setting SSH key for GitHub:   https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent
Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Git for windows:  https://git-scm.com/download/win

Some resources for learning git:  (I haven't read all of these all the way, but should be a decent starting place.)

(I would avoid w3schools for JS.  They tend to be a bit out-dated.)

MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
postman for testing: (https://www.getpostman.com/)

Once we get rolling, this README will become more of our documentation.
